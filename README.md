# JavasScript

## Introduction
This repo is a place to demonstrate and experiment with JavaScript and TypeScript
technologies such as NodeJS, Bower, Gulp, Electron, React, React Native, Ionic,
Monogo and any other JavaScript framework that I find interesting.

I hope to put up fully functioning examlpes as well as simple enough intro's 
and demonstrations of each.

How do I do this? I do this mostly by reading a Quick Start guide and then reading
the official documentation of the technology and then trying to build my own 
application using the technology. I nearly always try to make sure to use source maps
as they integrate with VS Code and I can read the API documentation while I code.
I highly reccommend this approach to anyone trying to learn any technology.

## About Me and JS
I started working in JS in November 2014 using JS mainly as a DOM manipulator within
the browser. I used JQuery library mostly, but as I got to understand the DOM and 
browsers more, I started using JQuery a lot less. I moved onto Angular 1.5 in May 2016
and moved from IBM WCM to pure Java EE, REST. The team was very small and no member
of the team had any previous experience using any of these technologies. 

We designed and built a Java MVC REST application and an Angular MVVM front end. In
April 2017 I was moved to a different project and asked to work with C# in an Azure
cloud as well as start using SharePoint Online Framework using React-DOM.

In November 2016 I was asked to do a research project in AWS Lambda Functions using
NodeJS.

In March 2016 I was asked to take part in a research project about in-house training.
They asked me to participate in a 5 hour course about Offline First. Very interesting
and I might cover that in this project.

As you can see I have used a variety of JavaScript technologies and Frameworks, for 
both back-end and front-end solutions, but none in native Mobile.
